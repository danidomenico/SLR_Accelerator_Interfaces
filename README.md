# C/C++ parallel programming interfaces to explore accelerators: a Systematic Literature Review

## What is here?
The **StArt file** and **XLS report** from a Systematic Literature Review that has as objective:
- Identifying and describing C/C++ parallel programming interfaces that are able to explore accelerators.
As ``able to explore accelerators'' will be considered the resources in those programming interfaces to explore standalone accelerators or heterogeneous processing environment (multicore + accelerator simultaneously).


The main question of this review is:
- What are, what features are offered and how can be used the C/C++ parallel programming interfaces to explore accelerators?

The population that was considered and selected as a potential input to this review are:
- Projects that offers a C/C++ parallel interface to develop parallel applications to explore accelerators.
The present SLR will not contemplate the classical interfaces to develop parallel programs (like Pthreads, OpenMP, OpenCL, OpenACC, CUDA).
Those programming interfaces are not representative to our study due several reasons: 
1- these traditional programming methods are well know in parallel programming area; 
2- most of them are suggested by hardware vendors as the standard tool to explore a parallel platform; and 
3- they are commonly employed as a resource for the studies which propose new parallel programming interfaces.


#### About StArt:
StArt is a software application that aims to help the researcher, giving support to the whole SLR process. The StArt tool has been used by graduate students from more than twenty countries.
