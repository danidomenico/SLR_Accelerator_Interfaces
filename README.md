# C/C++ parallel programming interfaces to explore accelerators: a Systematic Literature Review

## What is here?
The **StArt file** and **XLS report** from a Systematic Literature Review that has as objective:
- Identifying and describing C/C++ parallel programming interfaces that provide features to explore accelerators, where ``features to explore accelerators'' were considered the resources in those programming interfaces to explore just accelerators or heterogeneous processing.

The main question of this review is:
- What are, what features are offered and how can be used the C/C++ parallel programming interfaces to explore accelerators?

The population that was considered and selected as a potential input to this review are:
- Projects that offers a C/C++ parallel interface to develop parallel programs to explore accelerators.


#### About StArt:
StArt is a software application that aims to help the researcher, giving support to the whole SLR process. The StArt tool has been used by graduate students from more than twenty countries.
